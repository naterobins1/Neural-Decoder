# Neural-Decoder
MSc Neurotech - Brain Machine Interface Project

This is a KNN classifier and linear regression model coded in MATLAB. The models are trained on spike trains for 98 motor neurons and the xy coordinates of the monkeys hand in space. The models can then predict the xy coordinates of a monkey hand in space from unseen neural spiking patterns
